Scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue and prevents your liver from working normally. As cirrhosis gets worse, your liver begins to fail. Symptoms & Causes Cirrhosis has many signs and symptoms, such as fatigue and severe itchy skin. Symptoms may not appear until the liver is badly damaged. Causes include alcohol-associated liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic hepatitis C, and chronic hepatitis B. Diagnosis Doctors diagnose cirrhosis based on your medical history, a physical exam, and the results of tests. Tests include blood tests, which can show signs of liver damage or infections; imaging tests; and liver biopsy. Treatment Doctors do not have specific treatments that can cure cirrhosis. However, they can treat many of the diseases that cause cirrhosis. Treating the underlying causes of cirrhosis may keep cirrhosis from getting worse and may help prevent liver failure. Eating, Diet, & Nutrition If you have cirrhosis, talk with your doctor or a registered dietitian about planning healthy meals. Avoid foods and drinks that can damage the liver, such as raw shellfish and alcohol. Clinical Trials NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including liver diseases. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life.
