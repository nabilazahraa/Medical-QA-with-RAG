Digestive System & How it Works Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome Gastroparesis View or Print All Sections Definition & Facts Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from your stomach to your small intestine, even though there is no blockage in the stomach or intestines. Symptoms & Causes The symptoms of gastroparesis may include feeling full shortly after starting a meal, feeling full long after eating a meal, nausea, and vomiting. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. Diagnosis Doctors diagnose gastroparesis based on your medical history, a physical exam, symptoms, and medical tests, such as tests to measure stomach emptying. Your doctor may use medical tests to look for gastroparesis complications. Treatment How doctors treat gastroparesis depends on the cause, how bad your symptoms and complications are, and how well you respond to different treatments. If diabetes is causing your gastroparesis, your doctor will help you control your blood glucose levels. Eating, Diet, & Nutrition What you eat can help relieve gastroparesis symptoms. What you eat can also help make sure you get the right amount of nutrients, calories, and liquids if you are malnourished or dehydrated due to gastroparesis.
