Description Hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome is a condition characterized by overactivity of the parathyroid glands (hyperparathyroidism). The four parathyroid glands are located in the neck and secrete a hormone that regulates the body's use of calcium. Hyperparathyroidism disrupts the normal balance of calcium in the blood, which can lead to kidney stones , thinning of the bones ( osteoporosis ), nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure ( hypertension ), weakness, and fatigue. About 95 percent of people with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome will develop hyperparathyroidism during their lifetime. In people with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, hyperparathyroidism is caused by tumors that form in the parathyroid glands. Typically, only one of the four parathyroid glands is affected, but in some people, tumors are found in more than one gland. The tumors are usually a noncancerous (benign) type of tumor called an adenoma. Approximately 15 percent of people with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome develop a cancerous tumor called parathyroid carcinoma. People with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome may also have a type of benign tumor called a fibroma in the jaw. Even though jaw tumors are specified in the name of this condition, it is estimated that only 11 to 40 percent of affected individuals have this symptom. Other tumors, both benign and cancerous, are often seen in people with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. For example, tumors of the uterus occur in up to 50 percent of people with this condition. Uterine tumors are typically benign, but they can cause heavy menstrual bleeding or other symptoms. The kidneys are affected in about 20 percent of people with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. Benign kidney cysts are the most common kidney feature, but a rare cancerous tumor called Wilms tumor and other types of kidney tumor have also been found. Regular medical screening may assist in the early detection of the features of hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. Frequency The exact prevalence of hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome is unknown. Approximately 200 cases have been reported in the medical literature. It is estimated that up to 30 percent of individuals with parathyroid carcinoma have hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. Causes Variants (also called mutations) in the CDC73 gene cause hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. The CDC73 gene provides instructions for making a protein called parafibromin. This protein is found throughout the body and is likely involved in gene transcription, which is the first step in protein production. Parafibromin is also thought to play a role in cell growth and division (proliferation). It can either promote or inhibit cell proliferation depending on signals within the cell. CDC73 gene variants cause hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome by reducing the amount of functional parafibromin that is produced. Most of these variants cause the cell to produce a parafibromin protein that is abnormally short and does not function well. The uncontrolled cell proliferation that occurs without functional parafibromin can lead to the formation tumors. It is unknown why only certain tissues seem to be affected by changes in parafibromin. Some people with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome do not have any of the variants in the CDC73 gene that are known to cause this condition. The cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown.
