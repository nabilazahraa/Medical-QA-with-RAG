Description Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is a bone disorder that affects the hips. People with this condition often have pain in the hip joint and restricted movement. Usually, the condition involves only the right hip or only the left hip, but 10 to 20 percent of affected individuals have signs and symptoms in both hips. Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease begins in childhood, typically between 3 and 12 years of age. Boys are three to five times more likely than girls to be affected by Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease. Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease interrupts the blood supply to the upper end of the thigh bone (femoral head). The disruption in blood flow causes bone cells to die. As a result, the femoral head can become misshapen and may no longer move easily within the hip socket. This can cause hip or knee pain and limit the range of motion in the leg. The bone eventually begins to heal through a normal process called bone remodeling, by which old bone is removed and replaced by new bone. This cycle of breakdown and healing can recur multiple times. If the damage to the femoral head does not heal properly, one leg may become shorter than the other. Without proper treatment, some people with Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease will develop a painful joint disorder called osteoarthritis , which may require a hip replacement later in life. Frequency The number of people who receive a diagnosis of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease varies by geographic area and by population. As many as 29 in 100,000 children under the age of 15 are diagnosed with this condition. This condition is most common among white people. Causes The exact cause of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is not known. Some researchers have suggested that the condition is multifactorial, which means it is caused by a combination of genetic, lifestyle, environmental, and metabolic factors. Joint stress, blood clotting abnormalities, malnutrition, obesity, and exposure to cigarette smoke may all contribute to the development of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease. Some cases of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease were previously thought to be caused by variants (also called mutations) in the COL2A1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms type II collagen, which is found in connective tissues. Many researchers today, however, do not believe that variants in the COL2A1 gene cause Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease. Studies are investigating the potential causes of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, including the role genetics might play in this disorder. Inheritance In most cases, the cause of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is not known. When the condition runs in families, it typically follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.
