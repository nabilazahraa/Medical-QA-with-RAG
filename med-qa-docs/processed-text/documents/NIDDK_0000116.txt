Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome Microscopic Colitis View or Print All Sections Definition & Facts Microscopic colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in which abnormal reactions of the immune system cause inflammation of the inner lining of your colon. Anyone can develop microscopic colitis, but the disease is more common in older adults and in women. Symptoms & Causes The most common symptom of microscopic colitis is chronic diarrhea. Experts aren’t sure what causes microscopic colitis but think genes and abnormal immune reactions play a role. Certain medicines and smoking increase the risk for the disease. Diagnosis To help diagnose microscopic colitis, your doctor may order medical tests to check for signs of conditions that cause symptoms similar to those of microscopic colitis. Doctors order a colonoscopy with biopsies to diagnose microscopic colitis. Treatment To treat microscopic colitis, your doctor may recommend changing the medicines you take, changing your diet, quitting smoking, and taking medicines to help manage symptoms. Medicines may improve symptoms and help bring on and maintain remission. Eating, Diet, & Nutrition In some cases, doctors may recommend changing your diet to help reduce diarrhea symptoms in microscopic colitis. Talk with your doctor about what type of diet is right for you. Clinical Trials The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research into many diseases and conditions.
