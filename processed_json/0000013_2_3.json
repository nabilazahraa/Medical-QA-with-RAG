            "question": "What are the symptoms of Essential Thrombocythemia ?",
            "answer": "Patients with essential thrombocythemia may have no signs or symptoms. Essential thrombocythemia often does not cause early signs or symptoms. It may be found during a routine blood test. Signs and symptoms may be caused by essential thrombocytopenia or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         - Headache.    - Burning or tingling in the hands or feet.    - Redness and warmth of the hands or feet.    - Vision or hearing problems.        Platelets are sticky. When there are too many platelets, they may clump together and make it hard for the blood to flow. Clots may form in blood vessels and there may also be increased bleeding. These can cause serious health problems such as stroke or heart attack."

            "question": "What is the outlook for Essential Thrombocythemia ?",
            "answer": "Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for essential thrombocythemia. Prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - The age of the patient.    - Whether the patient has signs or symptoms or other problems related to essential thrombocythemia."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Essential Thrombocythemia ?",
            "answer": "Treatment of essential thrombocythemia in patients younger than 60 years who have no signs or symptoms and an acceptable platelet count is usually watchful waiting. Treatment of other patients may include the following:            -  Chemotherapy.     -  Anagrelide therapy.     -  Biologic therapy using interferon alfa or pegylated interferon alpha.     - Platelet apheresis.     - A clinical trial of a new treatment.            Check the list of NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with essential thrombocythemia. For more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you. General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website."
