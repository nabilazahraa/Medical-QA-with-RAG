            "question": "What is (are) What I need to know about Diarrhea ?",
            "answer": "Diarrhea is frequent, loose, and watery bowel movements. Bowel movements, also called stools, are body wastes passed through the rectum and anus. Stools contain what is left after your digestive system absorbs nutrients and fluids from what you eat and drink. If your body does not absorb the fluids, or if your digestive system produces extra fluids, stools will be loose and watery. Loose stools contain more water, salts, and minerals and weigh more than solid stools.\n                \nDiarrhea that lasts a short time is called acute diarrhea. Acute diarrhea is a common problem and usually lasts only 1 or 2 days, but it may last longer. Diarrhea that lasts for at least 4 weeks is called chronic diarrhea. Chronic diarrhea symptoms may be continual or they may come and go.\n                \n*See the Pronunciation Guide for tips on how to say the words in bold type."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of What I need to know about Diarrhea ?",
            "answer": "In addition to passing frequent, loose stools, other possible symptoms include\n                \n- cramps or pain in the abdomenthe area between the chest and hips  - an urgent need to use the bathroom  - loss of bowel control\n                \nYou may feel sick to your stomach or become dehydrated. If a virus or bacteria is the cause of your diarrhea, you may have fever and chills and bloody stools.\n                \nDehydration\n                \nBeing dehydrated means your body does not have enough fluid to work properly. Every time you have a bowel movement, you lose fluids. Diarrhea causes you to lose even more fluids. You also lose salts and minerals such as sodium, chloride, and potassium. These salts and minerals affect the amount of water that stays in your body.\n                \nDehydration can be serious, especially for children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.\n                \nSigns of dehydration in adults are\n                \n- being thirsty  - urinating less often than usual  - having dark-colored urine  - having dry skin  - feeling tired  - feeling dizzy or fainting\n                \nSigns of dehydration in babies and young children are\n                \n- having a dry mouth and tongue  - crying without tears  - having no wet diapers for 3 hours or more  - having sunken eyes, cheeks, or soft spot in the skull  - having a high fever  - being more cranky or drowsy than usual\n                \nAlso, when people are dehydrated, their skin does not flatten back to normal right away after being gently pinched and released."

            "question": "How to diagnose What I need to know about Diarrhea ?",
            "answer": "To find the cause of diarrhea, the health care provider may\n                \n- perform a physical exam  - ask about any medicines you are taking  - test your stool or blood to look for bacteria, parasites, or other signs of disease or infection  - ask you to stop eating certain foods to see whether your diarrhea goes away\n                \nIf you have chronic diarrhea, your health care provider may perform other tests to look for signs of disease."

            "question": "What are the treatments for What I need to know about Diarrhea ?",
            "answer": "Diarrhea is treated by replacing lost fluids, salts, and minerals to prevent dehydration.\n                \nTaking medicine to stop diarrhea can be helpful in some cases. Medicines you can buy over the counter without a prescription include loperamide (Imodium) and bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate). Stop taking these medicines if symptoms get worse or if the diarrhea lasts more than 2 days. If you have bloody diarrhea, you should not use over-the-counter diarrhea medicines. These medicines may make diarrhea last longer. The health care provider will usually prescribe antibiotics instead.\n                \nOver-the-counter medicines for diarrhea may be dangerous for babies and children. Talk with the health care provider before giving your child these medicines."

            "question": "How to prevent What I need to know about Diarrhea ?",
            "answer": "Two types of diarrhea can be preventedrotavirus diarrhea and travelers diarrhea.\n                \nRotavirus Diarrhea\n                \nTwo vaccines, RotaTeq and Rotarix, protect against rotavirusa common virus that causes diarrhea in babies and children. RotaTeq is given to babies in three doses at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Rotarix is given in two doses. The first dose is given when the baby is 6 weeks old, and the second is given at least 4 weeks later but before the baby is 24 weeks old. To learn more about rotavirus vaccines, talk with your childs health care provider. You can also find more information at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rotavirus vaccination webpage at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/rotavirus.\n                \nRotaTeq and Rotarix only prevent diarrhea caused by rotavirus. Children who have been vaccinated may still get diarrhea from another cause.\n                \nTravelers Diarrhea\n                \n\n                \nPeople may develop travelers diarrhea while visiting developing areas of the world such as Latin America, Africa, and southern Asia. Travelers diarrhea is caused by eating food or drinking water that contains harmful bacteria, viruses, or parasites.\n                \nYou can prevent travelers diarrhea by being careful:\n                \n- Do not drink tap water, use tap water to brush your teeth, or use ice cubes made from tap water.  - Do not eat or drink unpasteurized milk or milk products.  - Do not eat raw fruits and vegetables unless they can be peeled and you peel them yourself.  - Do not eat raw or rare meat and fish.  - Do not eat meat or shellfish that is not hot when served to you.  - Do not eat food sold by street vendors.\n                \nYou can drink bottled water, carbonated soft drinks, and hot drinks such as coffee and tea.\n                \nBefore traveling outside the United States, talk with your health care provider. Your health care provider may suggest taking medicine with you. In some cases, taking antibiotics before traveling can help prevent travelers diarrhea. And early treatment with antibiotics can shorten an episode of travelers diarrhea."
