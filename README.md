# Real-Time Medical Question-Answering with Retrieval-Augmented Generation on AWS

## Project Overview

In the healthcare sector, timely access to accurate medical knowledge is critical for informed decision-making. This project develops a **real-time medical document Question-Answering (QA) system** using **AWS cloud services** for scalable, low-latency information retrieval.

<!-- By integrating a **vector database (FAISS/Pinecone)** for document embedding retrieval and an **LLM (BioBERT)** for contextual Q&A, our system provides **precise and instant responses** to medical queries. The system focuses on **clinical guidelines, drug interactions, and disease-related questions**, ensuring rapid access to essential healthcare information. -->
