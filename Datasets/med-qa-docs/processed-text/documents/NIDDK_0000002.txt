These include cortisol, sometimes called the “stress hormone,” which is essential for life. Symptoms & Causes The most common symptoms are fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Adrenal insufficiency can be caused by autoimmune disease or suddenly stopping steroid medicines used to treat other conditions, among other causes. Diagnosis Doctors diagnose adrenal insufficiency with blood tests. Other tests, such as computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), help find the cause of this disorder. Treatment Doctors treat adrenal insufficiency with medicines that replace the hormones your body isn’t making. Your doctor will adjust your dose in special situations, such as during surgery, illness, or pregnancy; or after a serious injury. Eating, Diet, & Nutrition Some people with adrenal insufficiency may need a high-sodium diet. People who take medicines to replace cortisol also need plenty of calcium and vitamin D. A health care professional or dietitian can tell you how much you should have. Clinical Trials The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research into many diseases and conditions.
