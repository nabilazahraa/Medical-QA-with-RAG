Digestive System & How it Works Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome Crohn’s Disease View or Print All Sections Definition & Facts Crohn’s disease is a chronic disease that causes inflammation in the digestive tract and is more likely to develop in people between the ages of 20 and 29. Symptoms & Causes Symptoms of Crohn’s disease vary from person to person and may include diarrhea, cramping, and pain in your abdomen, and weight loss. Experts aren’t sure what causes Crohn’s disease but think genes, abnormal immune reactions, and the microbiome play a role. Diagnosis Doctors typically do not use a single test to diagnose Crohn’s disease. You may need a combination of tests. Your doctor will also ask you about your medical history and your family history and will perform a physical exam. Treatment Doctors treat Crohn’s disease with medicines and surgery. The goal of treatment is to decrease the inflammation in your intestines, prevent symptom flares, and keep you in remission. Eating, Diet, & Nutrition If you have Crohn’s disease, you should eat a healthy, well-balanced diet. Your doctor may recommend nutritional supplements and vitamins if your body doesn’t absorb enough nutrients. Clinical Trials NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including digestive diseases. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life. Your Digestive System & How it Works The digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract—also called the digestive tract—and the liver, pancreas, and the gallbladder. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus.
