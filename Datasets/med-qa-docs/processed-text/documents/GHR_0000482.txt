Description Histidinemia is an inherited condition characterized by elevated levels of histidine in blood, urine, and the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid). Histidine is an amino acid that acts as a building block for many different proteins. In most cases, histidinemia does not cause health problems. Most people with elevated histidine levels are unaware that they have this condition. Rarely, people with histidinemia have intellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, or behavioral problems. Having a medical complication during or soon after birth might increase the risk of developmental problems in people with histidinemia. Frequency Since many people who have histidinemia do not have signs and symptoms, it is hard to know exactly how many people have the condition. The condition appears to be more common among people of Japanese descent and among the French Canadian population in Quebec, Canada. Causes Histidinemia is caused by variants (also called mutations) in the HAL gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called histidase. Histidase breaks down histidine that the body gets from food. Histidase is active (expressed) primarily in the liver and the skin . HAL gene variants impair the enzyme's ability to break down histidine, which causes histidine to build up in the blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. Learn more about the gene associated with Histidinemia HAL Inheritance This condition is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern , which means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene.
