            "answer": "The A1C test, also called the hemoglobin A1C test, HbA1C, or glycohemoglobin test, is a blood test that reflects the average level of glucose in your blood during the past 3 months. Your A1C test result is given in percents. Your doctor might use the A1C test to help diagnose your diabetes. Your doctor will draw a sample of your blood in the office or send you to a lab to have a sample of your blood drawn for the test. After being diagnosed with diabetes, you should have the A1C test at least twice a year.\n                \nYour A1C result plus your record of blood glucose numbers show whether your blood glucose is under control.\n                \n- If your A1C result is too high, you may need to change your diabetes care plan. Your health care team can help you decide what part of your plan to change. For instance, you might need to change your meal plan, your diabetes medicines, or your physical activity plan.  - If your A1C result is on target, then your diabetes treatment plan is working. The lower your A1C is, the lower your chance of having diabetes problems.\n                \nThis chart shows the A1C goals for different types of people with diabetes.\n                \nTypes of People    A1C Goals          Most people with diabetes    below 7%        Women with diabetes who want to get pregnant or who are pregnant    below 6%\n                \nA1C goals can also depend on\n                \n- how long you have had diabetes  - whether or not you have other health problems\n                \nAsk your doctor what goal is right for you.\n                \n\n                \nThis chart shows how your A1C result may match up to your average blood glucose number.\n                \nWhat Your A1C Result Means          My A1C Result    My Average Blood Glucose Number        6%    135        7%    170        8%    205        9%    240        10%    275        11%    310        12%    345"

            "answer": "You can take steps each day to prevent diabetes problems.\n                \nSteps          Healthy Eating                     - Follow the healthy eating plan that you and your doctor or dietitian have made.      - Learn what to eat to keep your blood glucose levels under control.      - Make wise food choices to help you feel good every day and to lose weight if needed.            Blood Glucose                     - Check your blood glucose every day.      - Each time you check your blood glucose, write the number in a record book to share with your health care team.      - Treat low blood glucose quickly.            Physical Activity                     - Even small amounts of physical activity help manage diabetes. Aim for 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity most days of the week. Children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes who are 10 to 17 years old should aim for 60 minutes of activity every day.      - Not all physical activity has to take place at the same time.      - Do aerobic activities, such as brisk walking, which use your large muscles to make your heart beat faster. The large muscles are those of the upper and lower arms and legs and those that control head, shoulder, and hip movements.      - Do activities to strengthen muscles and bone, such as lifting weights or sit-ups. Aim for two times a week.      - Stretch to increase your flexibility, lower stress, and help prevent muscle soreness after physical activity.      - Increase daily activity by decreasing time spent watching TV or at the computer. Children and adolescents should limit screen time not related to school to less than 2 hours per day. Limiting screen time can help you meet your physical activity goal.      - Always talk with your doctor before you start a new physical activity program.            Medicines                     - Take your medicines as directed, including insulin if ordered by your doctor.            Feet                     - Check your feet every day for cuts, blisters, sores, swelling, redness, or sore toenails.            Mouth                     - Brush and floss your teeth every day.            Blood Pressure                     - Control your blood pressure and cholesterol.            Smoking                     - Dont smoke."
