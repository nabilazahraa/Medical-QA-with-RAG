            "question": "What is (are) Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease ?",
            "answer": "Anemia is a condition in which the body has fewer red blood cells than normal. Red blood cells carry oxygen to tissues and organs throughout the body and enable them to use energy from food. With anemia, red blood cells carry less oxygen to tissues and organsparticularly the heart and brainand those tissues and organs may not function as well as they should."

            "question": "What is (are) Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease ?",
            "answer": "The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine.\n                \nHealthy kidneys produce a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO). A hormone is a chemical produced by the body and released into the blood to help trigger or regulate particular body functions. EPO prompts the bone marrow to make red blood cells, which then carry oxygen throughout the body."

        {
            "question": "What causes Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease ?",
            "answer": "When kidneys are diseased or damaged, they do not make enough EPO. As a result, the bone marrow makes fewer red blood cells, causing anemia. When blood has fewer red blood cells, it deprives the body of the oxygen it needs.\n                \nOther common causes of anemia in people with kidney disease include blood loss from hemodialysis and low levels of the following nutrients found in food:\n                \n- iron  - vitamin B12  - folic acid\n                \nThese nutrients are necessary for red blood cells to make hemoglobin, the main oxygen-carrying protein in the red blood cells.\n                \nIf treatments for kidney-related anemia do not help, the health care provider will look for other causes of anemia, including\n                \n- other problems with bone marrow  - inflammatory problemssuch as arthritis, lupus, or inflammatory bowel diseasein which the bodys immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs  - chronic infections such as diabetic ulcers  - malnutrition"

            "answer": "Heart problems are a complication of anemia and may include\n                \n- an irregular heartbeat or an unusually fast heartbeat, especially when exercising.  - the harmful enlargement of muscles in the heart.  - heart failure, which does not mean the heart suddenly stops working. Instead, heart failure is a long-lasting condition in which the heart cant pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs."

            "question": "How to diagnose Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease ?",
            "answer": "A health care provider diagnoses anemia based on\n                \n- a medical history  - a physical exam  - blood tests\n                \nMedical History\n                \nTaking a medical history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to diagnose anemia. He or she will usually ask about the patients symptoms.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose anemia. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually examines a patients body, including checking for changes in skin color.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nTo diagnose anemia, a health care provider may order a complete blood count, which measures the type and number of blood cells in the body. A blood test involves drawing a patients blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility. A health care provider will carefully monitor the amount of hemoglobin in the patients blood, one of the measurements in a complete blood count.\n                \nThe Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Anemia Work Group recommends that health care providers diagnose anemia in males older than age 15 when their hemoglobin falls below 13 grams per deciliter (g/dL) and in females older than 15 when it falls below 12 g/dL.2 If someone has lost at least half of normal kidney function and has low hemoglobin, the cause of anemia may be decreased EPO production.\n                \nTwo other blood tests help measure iron levels:\n                \n- The ferritin level helps assess the amount of iron stored in the body. A ferritin score below 200 nanograms (ng) per liter may mean a person has iron deficiency that requires treatment.2  - The transferrin saturation score indicates how much iron is available to make red blood cells. A transferrin saturation score below 30 percent can also mean low iron levels that require treatment.2\n                \nIn addition to blood tests, the health care provider may order other tests, such as tests for blood loss in stool, to look for other causes of anemia."

            "question": "What are the treatments for Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease ?",
            "answer": "Depending on the cause, a health care provider treats anemia with one or more of the following treatments:\n                \nIron\n                \nThe first step in treating anemia is raising low iron levels. Iron pills may help improve iron and hemoglobin levels. However, for patients on hemodialysis, many studies show pills do not work as well as iron given intravenously.2\n                \nErythropoietin\n                \nIf blood tests indicate kidney disease as the most likely cause of anemia, treatment can include injections of a genetically engineered form of EPO. A health care provider, often a nurse, injects the patient with EPO subcutaneously, or under the skin, as needed. Some patients learn how to inject the EPO themselves. Patients on hemodialysis may receive EPO intravenously during hemodialysis.\n                \nStudies have shown the use of EPO increases the chance of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, in people with CKD. The health care provider will carefully review the medical history of the patient and determine if EPO is the best treatment for the patients anemia. Experts recommend using the lowest dose of EPO that will reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Additionally, health care providers should consider the use of EPO only when a patients hemoglobin level is below 10 g/dL. Health care providers should not use EPO to maintain a patients hemoglobin level above 11.5 g/dL.2 Patients who receive EPO should have regular blood tests to monitor their hemoglobin so the health care provider can adjust the EPO dose when the level is too high or too low.2 Health care providers should discuss the benefits and risks of EPO with their patients.\n                \nMany people with kidney disease need iron supplements and EPO to raise their red blood cell count to a level that will reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. In some people, iron supplements and EPO will improve the symptoms of anemia.\n                \nRed Blood Cell Transfusions\n                \nIf a patients hemoglobin falls too low, a health care provider may prescribe a red blood cell transfusion. Transfusing red blood cells into the patients vein raises the percentage of the patients blood that consists of red blood cells, increasing the amount of oxygen available to the body.\n                \nVitamin B12 and Folic Acid Supplements\n                \nA health care provider may suggest vitamin B12 and folic acid supplements for some people with CKD and anemia. Using vitamin supplements can treat low levels of vitamin B12 or folic acid and help treat anemia. To help ensure coordinated and safe care, people should discuss their use of complementary and alternative medical practices, including their use of dietary supplements, with their health care provider.\n                \nRead more about vitamin B12 and folic acid on the MedlinePlus website at www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus.

            "answer": "A health care provider may advise people with kidney disease who have anemia caused by iron, vitamin B12, or folic acid deficiencies to include sources of these nutrients in their diets. Some of these foods are high in sodium or phosphorus, which people with CKD should limit in their diet.
