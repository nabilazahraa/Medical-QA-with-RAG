            "question": "How to prevent Sexual and Urologic Problems of Diabetes ?",
            "answer": "People with diabetes can lower their risk of sexual and urologic problems by keeping their blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels close to the target numbers their health care provider recommends. Being physically active and maintaining a healthy weight can also help prevent the long-term complications of diabetes. For those who smoke, quitting will lower the risk of developing sexual and urologic problems due to nerve damage and also lower the risk for other health problems related to diabetes, including heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease.\n                \nMore information about preventing diabetes complications is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Prevent diabetes problems: Keep your diabetes under control, available from the National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse at 1-800-860-8747."
