            "question": "What is (are) Diabetic Kidney Disease ?",
            "answer": "Diabetic kidney disease, also called diabetic nephropathy, is kidney disease caused by diabetes. Even when well controlled, diabetes can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure, described as end-stage kidney disease or ESRD when treated with a kidney transplant or blood-filtering treatments called dialysis.\n                \nDiabetes affects 25.8 million people of all ages in the United States.1 As many as 40 percent of people who have diabetes are expected to develop CKD.2 Diabetes, the most common cause of kidney failure in the United States, accounts for nearly 44 percent of new cases of kidney failure, as illustrated in Figure 1.3"

            "question": "What is (are) Diabetic Kidney Disease ?",
            "answer": "The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. The bladder stores urine.\n                \nWhen the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder. In men the urethra is long, while in women it is short.\n                \nKidneys work at the microscopic level. The kidney is not one large filter. Each kidney is made up of about a million filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron filters a small amount of blood. The nephron includes a filter, called the glomerulus, and a tubule. The nephrons work through a two-step process. The glomerulus lets fluid and waste products pass through it; however, it prevents blood cells and large molecules, mostly proteins, from passing. The filtered fluid then passes through the tubule, which sends needed minerals back to the bloodstream and removes wastes. The final product becomes urine."

            "question": "What is (are) Diabetic Kidney Disease ?",
            "answer": "Diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. People with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia.\n                \nDiabetes is a disorder of metabolism the way the body uses digested food for energy. The digestive tract breaks down carbohydratessugars and starches found in many foodsinto glucose, a form of sugar that enters the bloodstream. With the help of the hormone insulin, cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for energy.\n                \nInsulin is made in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach and below the liver. As blood glucose levels rise after a meal, the pancreas is triggered to release insulin. The pancreas contains clusters of cells called pancreatic islets. Beta cells within the pancreatic islets make insulin and release it into the blood.\n                \nDiabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin, is not able to use insulin effectively, or both. As a result, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body. The bodys cells are then starved of energy despite high blood glucose levels."

            "question": "What are the symptoms of Diabetic Kidney Disease ?",
            "answer": "People with diabetic kidney disease do not have symptoms in the early stages. As kidney disease progresses, a person can develop edema, or swelling. Edema happens when the kidneys cannot get rid of the extra fluid and salt in the body. Edema can occur in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face. Once kidney function decreases further, symptoms may include\n                \n- appetite loss  - nausea  - vomiting  - drowsiness, or feeling tired  - trouble concentrating  - sleep problems  - increased or decreased urination  - generalized itching or numbness  - dry skin  - headaches  - weight loss  - darkened skin  - muscle cramps  - shortness of breath  - chest pain"

            "question": "How to diagnose Diabetic Kidney Disease ?",
            "answer": "A health care provider diagnoses diabetic kidney disease based on\n                \n- a medical and family history  - a physical exam  - urine tests  - a blood test\n                \nMedical and Family History\n                \nTaking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose diabetic kidney disease. He or she will ask about the symptoms and the patients diabetes history.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nAfter taking a medical and family history, a health care provider will perform a physical exam. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines the patients body to check for changes in skin color  - taps on specific areas of the patients body, checking for swelling of the feet, ankles, or lower legs\n                \nUrine Tests\n                \nDipstick test for albumin. A dipstick test performed on a urine sample can detect the presence of albumin in the urine. A patient collects the urine sample in a special container in a health care providers office or a commercial facility. The office or facility tests the sample onsite or sends it to a lab for analysis. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine. Patches on the dipstick change color when blood or protein is present in urine.\n                \nUrine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. A health care provider uses this measurement to estimate the amount of albumin passed into the urine over a 24-hour period. The patient collects a urine sample during an appointment with the health care provider. Creatinine is a waste product that is filtered in the kidneys and passed into the urine. A high urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio indicates that the kidneys are leaking large amounts of albumin into the urine. A urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio above 30 mg/g may be a sign of kidney disease.\n                \nBlood Test\n                \nA blood test involves having blood drawn at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. A health care provider may order a blood test to estimate how much blood the kidneys filter each minute, called the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The results of the test indicate the following:\n                \n- eGFR of 60 or above is in the normal range  - eGFR below 60 may indicate kidney damage  - eGFR of 15 or below may indicate kidney failure"

            "question": "How to prevent Diabetic Kidney Disease ?",
            "answer": "People can prevent or slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease by\n                \n- taking medications to control high blood pressure  - managing blood glucose levels  - making changes in their eating, diet, and nutrition  - losing weight if they are overweight or obese  - getting regular physical activity\n                \nPeople with diabetes should see a health care provider who will help them learn to manage their diabetes and monitor their diabetes control. Most people with diabetes get care from primary care providers, including internists, family practice doctors, or pediatricians. However, having a team of health care providers can often improve diabetes care. In addition to a primary care provider, the team can include\n                \n- an endocrinologista doctor with special training in diabetes  - a nephrologista doctor who specializes in treating people who have kidney problems or related conditions  - diabetes educators such as a nurse or dietitian  - a podiatrista doctor who specializes in foot care  - an ophthalmologist or optometrist for eye care  - a pharmacist  - a dentist  - a mental health counselor for emotional support and access to community resources\n                \nThe team can also include other health care providers and specialists.\n                \nBlood Pressure Medications\n                \nMedications that lower blood pressure can also significantly slow the progression of kidney disease. Two types of blood pressure-lowering medications, angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have been shown to slow the progression of kidney disease. Many people require two or more medications to control their blood pressure. In addition to an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, a health care provider may prescribe a diuretica medication that helps the kidneys remove fluid from the blood. A person may also need beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure medications.\n                \nPeople should talk with their health care provider about their individual blood pressure goals and how often they should have their blood pressure checked.\n                \nManaging Blood Glucose Levels\n                \nPeople manage blood glucose levels by\n                \n- testing blood glucose throughout the day  - following a diet and physical activity plan  - taking insulin throughout the day based on food and liquid intake and physical activity\n                \nPeople with diabetes need to talk with their health care team regularly and follow their directions closely. The goal is to keep blood glucose levels within the normal range or within a range set by the persons health care team. More information about diabetes is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2014  - Diagnosis of Diabetes and Prediabetes\n                \nEating, Diet, and Nutrition\n                \nFollowing a healthy eating plan can help lower blood pressure and control blood sugar. A health care provider may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan. DASH focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and lower in sodium, which often comes from salt. The DASH eating plan\n                \n- is low in fat and cholesterol  - features fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products, fish, poultry, and nuts  - suggests less red meat, and fewer sweets, added sugars, and sugarcontaining beverages  - is rich in nutrients, protein, and fiber\n                \nRead more about DASH at www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dash.\n                \nPeople with diabetic kidney disease may need to limit sodium and salt intake to help reduce edema and lower blood pressure. A dietitian may also recommend a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol to help control high levels of lipids, or fats, in the blood.\n                \nHealth care providers may recommend that people with CKD eat moderate or reduced amounts of protein, though the benefits of reducing protein in a persons diet are still being researched. Proteins break down into waste products the kidneys must filter from the blood. Eating more protein than the body needs may burden the kidneys and cause kidney function to decline faster. However, protein intake that is too low may lead to malnutrition, a condition that occurs when the body does not get enough nutrients.

Overweight is defined as a body mass index (BMI)a measurement of weight in relation to heightof 25 to 29. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese. People should aim to keep their BMI lower than 25.4\n                \nExperts recommend physical activity as an important part of losing weight, keeping sensitivity to insulin, and treating high blood pressure. Most people should try to get at least 30 to 60 minutes of activity most or all days of the week. A person can do all physical activity at once or break up activities into shorter periods of at least 10 minutes each. Moderate activities include brisk walking, dancing, bowling, riding a bike, working in a garden, and cleaning the house.

            "question": "What are the treatments for Diabetic Kidney Disease ?",
            "answer": "A health care provider may treat kidney failure due to diabetic kidney disease with dialysis or a kidney transplant. In some cases, people with diabetic kidney disease receive kidney and pancreas transplants.\n                \nIn most cases, people with diabetic kidney disease start dialysis earlier than people with kidney failure who do not have diabetes. People with diabetic end-stage kidney disease who receive a kidney transplant have a much better survival rate than those people on dialysis, although survival rates for those on dialysis have increasingly improved over time. However, people who receive a kidney transplant and do not have diabetes have a higher survival rate than people with diabetic kidney disease who receive a transplant.5\n                \nMore information about treatment options for kidney failure is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Hemodialysis  - Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Peritoneal Dialysis  - Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Transplantation"

            "question": "What to do for Diabetic Kidney Disease ?",
            "answer": "- Diabetic kidney disease, also called diabetic nephropathy, is kidney disease caused by diabetes.  - People with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia.  - At the onset of diabetes, blood flow into the kidneys increases, which may strain the glomeruli and lessen their ability to filter blood.  - Higher levels of blood glucose lead to the buildup of extra material in the glomeruli, which increases the force of the blood moving through the kidneys and creates stress in the glomeruli.  - Many people with diabetes can develop high blood pressure, another factor in the development of kidney disease. High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is an increase in the amount of force that blood places on blood vessels as it moves through the entire body.  - Diabetic kidney disease takes many years to develop.  - People with diabetic kidney disease do not have any symptoms in the early stages. As kidney disease progresses, a person can develop edema, or swelling. Edema happens when the kidneys cannot get rid of the extra fluid and salt in the body. Edema can occur in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face.  - Once kidney function decreases further, symptoms may include      - appetite loss    - nausea    - vomiting    - drowsiness, or feeling tired    - trouble concentrating    - sleep problems    - increased or decreased urination    - generalized itching or numbness    - dry skin    - headaches    - weight loss    - darkened skin    - muscle cramps    - shortness of breath    - chest pain    - People can prevent or slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease by      - taking medication to control high blood pressure    - managing blood glucose levels    - making changes in their eating, diet, and nutrition    - losing weight if they are overweight or obese    - getting regular physical activity"
